# AUT-Machine-Learning

In this repository, you will find the projects I completed for the Machine Learning course during my Master's degree at Amir Kabir University back in early 2017. In 2024, I revisited the code, updated it, and added detailed PDF LaTeX reports explaining each project thoroughly.

## Project Overview

This repository includes the following:
- **MATLAB Projects**: Several projects implemented in MATLAB, focusing on different ML concepts.
- **Python Projects**: Updated implementations using Python, incorporating modern libraries and techniques.
- **Weka Project**: A project involving data analysis and ML algorithms using the Weka software.
